# ListOfFakeNewsClassifiedSites

To be able to detect as many URLs as possible and, at the same time, reduce sample selection bias and ensure 
correct classification of the websites, we used five different lists. These lists come from different sources 
with different selection criteria. Most of the websites in these lists overlapped each other, indicating that 
the lists have undergone a robust verification. 

i)	  Paper by Grinberg et al. (2019) – 490 URLs
ii)	  List by OpenSources (2017) – 833 URLs
iii)	Paper by Allcott et al. (2019) – 672 URLs
iv)	  List by Politifact (2017) – 327 URLs
